A Measured But Ambitious Project According to an exclusive report from The Big Whale, clients of four regional banks, including Banque Populaire Île-de-France and Caisse d’Épargne Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur, will be able to buy and sell bitcoin BTC, ether (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Circle’s USDC directly through their banking apps. The service will reach approximately 2 million customers in the pilot phase, with BPCE planning to expand access gradually across its remaining 25 regional entities throughout 2026, ultimately making crypto trading available to its full 12-million-strong retail base. A bank representative reportedly told the news outlet that the phased launch is intended to “monitor how the service performs at launch” before scaling. Cryptocurrency purchases and sales will be handled via a dedicated digital asset account within the banking apps, overseen by BPCE’s crypto-focused subsidiary, Hexarq, according to The Big Whale. The account comes with a 2.99 euros ($3.48) monthly fee and a 1.5% trading fee, with a minimum charge of $1.16 per trade. Customers will be able to access the service without requiring external crypto exchanges or third-party wallets. Advertisement European Banks Embrace Crypto BPCE’s roll-out comes amid increasing competition across Europe between traditional banking institutions and crypto-friendly fintechs, including Revolut and Trade Republic, all of which are giving customers access to digital assets. Other European banks have made similar moves. Spanish banking giant BBVA earlier this year allowed its customers to buy, sell, and hold BTC and ETH directly within its banking app, supported by in-house custody.

In a post on the X platform, the investor gave reasons behind his audacious move. XRP Has Far Greater Legal Clarity In The U.S. Popular market pundit, going by the online alias Crypto X AiMan, revealed in an X post that he had gone “100% all-in on XRP” after selling all his Bitcoin. According to the investor, XRP is the only crypto in the United States with actual regulatory clarity. Bitcoin has long been considered a commodity by several U.S. regulators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, raising no concerns regarding the top crypto’s status. Former SEC Chairman Gary Gensler recently reiterated this viewpoint, noting that Bitcoin stands apart from thousands of other cryptocurrencies, which he described as “highly speculative” assets. Advertisement Although Bitcoin has regulatory clarity, XRP is the only crypto asset to have been subjected to heavy scrutiny for several years, but it emerged victorious following the August 2025 joint dismissal of appeals in the SEC vs. Ripple case. The resolution left Judge Torres’ 2023 ruling intact: that XRP in itself is not a security, removing a key overhang that had impeded institutional adoption for years. For Crypto X AiMan, this makes XRP pretty unique. Ripple’s Considerable XRP Holdings Another reason he chose to rotate from BTC to XRP was because of Ripple’s massive XRP stockpile. Notably, Ripple currently owns nearly 40 billion XRP tokens, which accounts for approximately 40% of the total XRP supply. Ripple, being the largest holder of XRP tokens, has raised concerns that it can hurt...","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","keywords":["crypto","bitcoin"],"creator":["Bitcoin Ethereum News"],"coin":["BTC","XRP"],"language":"english","pubDate":"2025-12-07 23:35:12","pubDateTZ":"Asia/Singapore","image_url":null,"video_url":null,"source_id":"bitcoinethereumnews","source_name":"Bitcoin Ethereum News","source_priority":2178265,"source_url":"https://bitcoinethereumnews.com","source_icon":"https://n.bytvi.com/crypto/bitcoinethereumnews.png","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","duplicate":false},{"article_id":"6748e296f8909f435f65c5daddc169f0","link":"https://zycrypto.com/peter-schiff-and-cz-clash-in-high-profile-gold-vs-bitcoin-showdown/","title":"Peter Schiff and CZ Clash In High-Profile Gold vs Bitcoin Showdown","description":"Gold bug Peter Schiff and Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) have faced off in a widely anticipated debate over the utility of gold and Bitcoin (BTC).","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","keywords":["btcusd","btcusdt","cryptocurrency news","xbtusd","gold","bitcoin","changpeng zhao","bitcoin news","news","peter schiff","btcusdc"],"creator":null,"coin":["BTC"],"language":"english","pubDate":"2025-12-07 23:33:30","pubDateTZ":"Asia/Singapore","image_url":null,"video_url":null,"source_id":"zycrypto","source_name":"Zycrypto","source_priority":1265755,"source_url":"https://zycrypto.com","source_icon":"https://n.bytvi.com/crypto/zycrypto.png","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","duplicate":false},{"article_id":"7c8831e66a62becbcfa4fa51e7999faa","link":"https://en.coinotag.com/cz-advises-bitcoin-private-keys-should-never-leave-hardware-wallets-for-security","title":"CZ Advises: Bitcoin Private Keys Should Never Leave Hardware Wallets for Security","description":"Changpeng Zhao, founder of Binance, states that the non-negotiable principle for hardware wallet security is ensuring the private key never leaves the device.
